4. Month 8-10: Prove value, formalize partnerships
5. Month 11-12: Expand to 10 total

---

### Priority #3: Document and Productize the Methodology

**Why**: IP defensibility, content marketing, licensing revenue

**Timeline**: 50% by Month 6, 100% by Month 9

**Investment**: €30-50K (technical writer, founder time, design)

**Success Metrics**:
- 10 methodologies fully documented
- 500+ downloads of free resources

---

## ❌ What to Say NO To (Anti-Priorities)

### 1. Enterprise Clients (Series B+, Large Companies)
- Different sales cycle (6-12 months vs 4-6 weeks)
- Complex procurement, feature requests diverge
- **Exception**: If building internal startup studio

### 2. Full Custom Development (Outside Startup Journey)
- Doesn't fit methodology, hard to scale
- Competitive, low margin
- **Exception**: If feeds platform development

### 3. Industries Requiring Deep Domain Expertise
- Healthcare (HIPAA), fintech (regulations)
- Requires specialized hires, distracts from platform
- **Exception**: Partner with domain expert

### 4. Geographic Expansion Beyond Spain (Year 1)
- Haven't achieved PMF yet
- Different markets, spread too thin
- **Exception**: Strategic accelerator partnership

### 5. Feature Requests Outside Startup Journey
- Dilutes platform focus
- **Exception**: If 5+ clients request AND fits vision

## 💡 Key Decisions Needed (Founders Align)

### Decision #1: Funding Strategy
**Options**: Bootstrap | Seed Round (€500K-1M) | Hybrid (Revenue-Based Financing)

**Recommendation**: Start bootstrap, raise seed at Month 12 if:
- €150K+ MRR
- 10+ accelerator partnerships
- Clear platform traction (50+ users)

### Decision #2: Platform Build vs Buy
**Options**: Build from Scratch | License Tools | Open Source + Build Proprietary

**Recommendation**: **Open Source + Build Proprietary**
- Use LangChain, OpenAI/Anthropic APIs
- Build unique IP: startup prompts, methodology integration, benchmarks

### Decision #3: Team Structure
**Options**: Unified Team | Separate Teams | Hybrid with Rotation

**Recommendation**: **Separate in Year 1, Hybrid in Year 2**
- Services delivery team (5-7 people)
- Product team (2-4 people, protected time)
- Rotate for empathy in Year 2

### Decision #4: Accelerator Partnership Model
**Options**: Revenue Share | Flat Retainer | Equity Participation

**Recommendation**: **Retainer + Equity Hybrid**
- €5-15K/month retainer for office hours
- Services sold to startups (accelerator commission)
- Equity (0.5-1%) for high-potential startups

### Decision #5: Open Source Strategy
**Options**: Fully Proprietary | Fully Open Source | Open Core

**Recommendation**: **Open Core**
- Open: Basic methodology guides (marketing, SEO)
- Closed: Platform, proprietary data, advanced features

## 🎓 Key Learnings & Insights

### Insight #1: Accelerator Partnerships are the Unlock
Traditional B2B sales is slow and expensive for startups. Accelerators provide:
- **Efficient distribution**: 1 partnership = 10-30 clients
- **Built-in trust**: Accelerator endorsement reduces sales friction
- **Recurring pipeline**: Each cohort = predictable demand
- **Lower CAC**: €500-1K vs €3K+ for direct sales

**Action**: Prioritize accelerator partnerships over direct sales in Year 1.

### Insight #2: Platform Adoption Requires Services Integration
Many SaaS + Services companies fail because customers don't adopt the platform. Success requires:
- **Mandatory usage**: All services clients must use platform
- **Value demonstration**: Show ROI with data (time saved, quality improved)
- **Transition support**: Help clients move to platform-only
- **Incentives**: Discount services if using platform

**Action**: Make platform usage mandatory from Day 1 of service engagement.

### Insight #3: Data is the Long-Term Moat
AI tools will commoditize, but proprietary data from services work creates defensibility:
- **Startup patterns**: What works, what doesn't (200+ data points)
- **Benchmarks**: Velocity, quality, time-to-market by stage/industry
- **Predictive insights**: Early indicators of PMF, technical risk scoring

**Action**: Systematically collect and analyze data from every client engagement.

### Insight #4: Methodology IP is Underrated Differentiation
Agencies compete on price and talent. Collybrix competes on proven methodology:
- **10 adaptive frameworks**: Not one-size-fits-all, tailored to context
- **XP expertise**: Deep specialization in Extreme Programming
- **Licensing potential**: Revenue from methodology alone (€25-100K/partner)

**Action**: Document, brand, and promote "Collybrix Method" aggressively.

### Insight #5: Hybrid Model Requires Discipline
Without clear separation, services always wins (urgent > important):
- **Separate teams**: Services team ≠ Product team
- **Protected time**: 80% of product team untouchable by services
- **Revenue mix targets**: Year 1 (90/10), Year 2 (50/50), Year 3 (30/70)
- **Founders enforce**: Only founders can break the wall

**Action**: Create physical/organizational separation from Day 1.

## 🚀 Final Thoughts

### The Opportunity

You're building in a **perfect storm of opportunity**:
1. **Market timing**: AI wave + startup recovery + fractional model acceptance
2. **White space**: No dominant "Agentic Technical Partner" yet
3. **Distribution**: Accelerators provide efficient B2B2C channel
4. **Defensibility**: Data moat + methodology IP + network effects

### The Challenge

You have a **12-18 month window** before larger players notice:
- Toptal, EPAM, Accenture launching "startup divisions"
- AI dev shops emerging (10+ competitors already)
- No-code platforms improving (reducing TAM)

**Speed matters**. Lock in 30+ accelerator partnerships before competition intensifies.

### The Path to Category Leadership

1. **Year 1**: Prove hybrid model (€600K revenue, 10 partnerships, 50 platform users)
2. **Year 2**: Scale what works (€1.8M revenue, 30 partnerships, 500 users)
3. **Year 3**: Platform-led dominance (€4M revenue, category leadership)

### The Execution Mindset

**Done > Perfect**. Ship fast, iterate, learn. This strategy gives you a roadmap, but reality will force adjustments. Stay focused on:
- **North Star**: Successful startup launches
- **Top 3 Priorities**: PRD Generator, 10 accelerators, methodology IP
- **Anti-Priorities**: Enterprise, custom dev, geographic expansion (Year 1)

**The hybrid model is your competitive advantage. Execute it well, and Collybrix becomes the category-defining "Agentic Technical Partner" for European startups.**

**Good luck building!** 🚀
