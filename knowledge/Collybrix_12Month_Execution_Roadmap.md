## Critical Success Factors (Retrospective)

### What Worked

1. **Accelerator Channel**: Most efficient CAC, predictable pipeline
2. **Platform Mandatory for Services**: Drove adoption, validated product-market fit
3. **Methodology IP**: Differentiation from generic agencies
4. **Result-Based Pricing**: Aligned incentives, faster sales cycles
5. **Quality Obsession**: NPS 62 drove referrals (30% of new business)

### What Didn't Work (Lessons Learned)

1. **Outbound Sales**: Low conversion, high effort (shifted to inbound + partnerships)
2. **Custom Development**: High variance, hard to scale (productized services)
3. **Pricing Too Low**: Undervalued initially (raised prices Month 10)
4. **Platform Marketing**: Product Hunt didn't drive much growth (partnerships did)
5. **Hiring Too Slow**: Should have hired developer #3 and #4 earlier

### Key Pivots Made

1. **Month 2**: Added mandatory platform usage for all services clients
2. **Month 5**: Shifted from outbound to accelerator partnerships (10x ROI)
3. **Month 8**: Introduced self-serve platform tier (PLG motion)
4. **Month 10**: Capped services growth, focused on platform expansion
