## Part 3: Operational Playbooks

### 3.1 Services Delivery Playbook

#### Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

**SOP #1: Client Onboarding**
1. Contract signed → Create client workspace (Notion, Linear, Slack)
2. Schedule kickoff call (within 3 business days)
3. Send onboarding questionnaire (founders, team, goals, constraints)
4. Assign Tech Lead + Development Team
5. Setup integrations (GitHub, analytics, etc.)
6. Kickoff call: Expectations, timeline, communication norms

**SOP #2: Discovery Sprint Delivery** (1-2 weeks)
- Day 1-2: Founder interviews, market research, competitor analysis
- Day 3-5: PRD generation (using AI platform), architecture design
- Day 6-8: User story mapping, scope sizing, team recommendations
- Day 9-10: Presentation, refinement, handoff
- Deliverables: PRD document, architecture diagram, roadmap, proposal for MVP Builder

**SOP #3: MVP Builder Delivery** (8-12 weeks)
- Week 1: Team building, training, methodology selection, sprint 0 (infrastructure)
- Week 2-10: Development sprints (2-week sprints, 4-5 total)
- Week 11: Beta testing, bug fixes, performance optimization
- Week 12: Production deployment, handoff, documentation
- Deliverables: Live production app, codebase, documentation, trained team

**SOP #4: Quality Assurance Checkpoints**
- Weekly: Code review (all PRs reviewed within 24 hours)
- Sprint: Demo to founders, collect feedback, adjust roadmap
- Mid-project: Architecture review, technical debt assessment
- Pre-launch: Security audit, performance testing, load testing
- Post-launch: 30-day warranty support, bug fixes included

#### Resource Management

**Utilization Targets**:
- Senior developers: 75-80% billable
- Junior developers: 65-70% billable (training overhead)
- Tech Leads: 60-70% billable (advisory, internal projects)

**Capacity Planning Formula**:
```
Monthly Capacity = (# Developers × 160 hours × Utilization Rate) / Avg Hours per Project
Example: (5 devs × 160h × 75%) / 400h per project = 1.5 projects/month
```

**Project Allocation**:
- Each developer max 2 concurrent projects
- Each Tech Lead oversees 3-4 projects
- Founders review all projects weekly

#### Pricing & Scoping

**Estimation Framework**:
1. **Scope Features**: Count user stories, epics
2. **Estimate Complexity**: T-shirt sizing (S/M/L/XL) or story points
3. **Calculate Hours**: Story points × hours per point (historical data)
4. **Add Buffer**: 20% for unknowns, technical debt, scope creep
5. **Price**: Hours × blended rate (or value-based pricing)

**Blended Rate Calculation**:
```
Services Cost = Salaries + Overhead (30%) + Platform Costs
Blended Rate = Services Cost / Billable Hours
Target: €80-120/hour effective rate (sell value, not hours)
```

**Value-Based Pricing Examples**:
- Client raises €500K → they value MVP at €100K → price at €60-80K (20% discount to hourly but premium to us)
- Client has 6-month runway → speed worth premium → price at higher end

### 3.2 Platform Development Playbook

#### Product Development Process

**Stage 1: Discovery & Validation**
1. Identify pain point (from services work or user feedback)
2. Size opportunity (% of users affected, frequency, severity)
3. Define success metrics (usage, retention, NPS impact)
4. Create 1-pager: Problem, solution, metrics, effort estimate
5. Founders review and prioritize

**Stage 2: Design & Specification**
1. User stories and acceptance criteria
2. Wireframes or mockups (Figma)
3. Technical design doc (architecture, data model, APIs)
4. Security and performance considerations
5. Engineering review and estimation

**Stage 3: Development & Testing**
1. Sprint planning (2-week sprints)
2. Daily standups (async or 15-min sync)
3. Code review (all PRs require approval)
4. Automated testing (unit, integration, E2E)
5. QA testing (manual + automated)

**Stage 4: Launch & Iteration**
1. Beta launch to 10-20 early users
2. Collect feedback (NPS, feature requests, bugs)
3. Iterate for 2-4 weeks
4. General availability launch
5. Monitor usage and performance

**Stage 5: Growth & Optimization**
1. Track adoption (% of users using feature)
2. Measure impact (business metrics: retention, expansion, NPS)
3. Optimize UX (reduce friction, improve onboarding)
4. Scale infrastructure (if usage high)

#### Platform Roadmap Prioritization

**Framework: RICE Scoring**
- **Reach**: How many users affected per quarter?
- **Impact**: How much impact per user? (0.25 = low, 3 = massive)
- **Confidence**: How confident in estimates? (50-100%)
- **Effort**: How many person-months required?

**Formula**: Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

**Example**:
- PRD Generator: (1000 users × 3 impact × 80% confidence) / 4 months = 600 score
- Team Chat: (500 users × 1 impact × 90% confidence) / 2 months = 225 score
- → Prioritize PRD Generator

**Quarterly Planning**:
1. List all ideas in backlog
2. Score using RICE
3. Sort by score (highest first)
4. Allocate resources (consider dependencies, strategic importance)
5. Commit to top 3-5 features for quarter
6. Review monthly, adjust as needed

### 4.3 Unit Economics

#### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**Year 1**:
- Total sales & marketing spend: €80K
- New customers acquired: 60
- **CAC = €80K / 60 = €1,333**

**By Channel**:
- Accelerator partnerships: €500 (1 partnership effort = 10 startups)
- Inbound (content, SEO): €1,500
- Outbound (cold outreach): €3,000
- Referrals: €500

**Year 2**:
- Total spend: €200K
- New customers: 100
- **CAC = €2,000**

**Year 3**:
- Total spend: €400K
- New customers: 250
- **CAC = €1,600** (PLG reducing CAC)

#### Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

**Services Client**:
- Average contract: €60K (first engagement)
- Expansion: 40% take Scale-Up (€180K more)
- Platform subscription: 60% convert (€1,500/mo × 24 months = €36K)
- **LTV = €60K + (40% × €180K) + (60% × €36K) = €60K + €72K + €21.6K = €153.6K**

**Platform-Only Client**:
- Average subscription: €1,000/mo
- Lifetime: 30 months (2.5 years)
- Expansion: Upgrade to higher tier (30% of customers, +€500/mo average)
- **LTV = (€1,000 × 30) + (30% × €500 × 20 months) = €30K + €3K = €33K**

**Blended LTV**:
- Year 1: €80K (mostly services)
- Year 2: €60K (hybrid mix)
- Year 3: €50K (more platform-only, but higher expansion)

#### Key Ratios

**LTV/CAC**:
- Year 1: €80K / €1.3K = **61.5:1** (exceptional, accelerator efficiency)
- Year 2: €60K / €2K = **30:1** (strong, hybrid model)
- Year 3: €50K / €1.6K = **31.3:1** (excellent, PLG scaling)

**Benchmark**: >3:1 is healthy, >5:1 is strong, Collybrix is exceptional.

**Payback Period**:
- Services: 1-2 months (large upfront payment)
- Platform: 6-9 months (monthly subscription)
- Blended: 4-6 months

**Benchmark**: <12 months is good, Collybrix is excellent.

**Net Revenue Retention (NRR)**:
- Year 1: 80% (new business, some churn, limited expansion)
- Year 2: 100% (expansion offsets churn)
- Year 3: 120% (platform expansion revenue >churn)

**Benchmark**: >100% is growth from existing customers, 120% is world-class.

## Part 5: Risk Management

### 5.1 Hybrid Model Risks

#### Risk #1: Resource Allocation Conflicts

**Scenario**: Services team constantly "borrows" product engineers for urgent client work.

**Impact**: Platform development stalls, timeline slips, competitive disadvantage.

**Mitigation**:
1. **Separate teams**: Clear boundary between services and product
2. **Protected time**: 80% of product team time is protected, 20% can flex to services
3. **Escalation**: Only founders can pull product engineers to services
4. **Prioritization**: Quarterly planning with clear product roadmap commitments
5. **Compensation**: Product team bonuses tied to platform milestones, not services revenue

#### Risk #2: Services Scaling Bottleneck

**Scenario**: Services demand outpaces hiring, utilization exceeds 90%, quality drops.

**Impact**: Missed deadlines, unhappy clients, team burnout, churn.

**Mitigation**:
1. **Capacity limits**: Cap new clients per month (e.g., max 5 new engagements/month)
2. **Waitlist**: When at capacity, put clients on waitlist with estimated start date
3. **Pricing**: Increase prices when utilization >80% (demand signal)
4. **Productization**: Standardize services to increase efficiency
5. **Platform**: Accelerate platform to reduce services dependency

#### Risk #3: Platform Adoption Failure

**Scenario**: Services clients don't adopt platform, platform-only sales don't materialize.

**Impact**: Stuck in services-only business, low margins, not scalable.

**Mitigation**:
1. **Mandatory usage**: All services clients must use platform during engagement
2. **Incentives**: Discount services if they use platform
3. **Value demonstration**: Show ROI (time saved, quality improved) with data
4. **Transition support**: Dedicated customer success to help clients move to platform-only
5. **Feedback loop**: Iterate platform based on services client feedback

#### Risk #4: Margin Pressure

**Scenario**: Competition drives services pricing down, platform revenue grows slower than expected.

**Impact**: Gross margin declines, profitability delayed, cash flow issues.

**Mitigation**:
1. **Value-based pricing**: Focus on outcomes, not hours
2. **Differentiation**: Lean into AI + methodology IP (hard to replicate)
3. **Premium positioning**: Target clients who value quality over cost
4. **Efficiency**: Platform should reduce services cost (higher margin even at same price)
5. **Mix shift**: Accelerate platform mix to improve blended margin

### 5.2 Competitive Risks

#### Risk #1: AI Commoditization

**Scenario**: ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, or Cursor become so good that basic AI dev services are free.

**Impact**: Perceived differentiation disappears, pricing pressure.

**Mitigation**:
1. **Services value**: Human expertise (strategy, architecture, team building) remains valuable
2. **Proprietary data**: Build dataset from services work → better AI than generic models
3. **Vertical focus**: Specialize in startup patterns (general AI tools are horizontal)
4. **Methodology IP**: XP frameworks are differentiator, not just AI
5. **Community**: Network effects from accelerator partnerships and alumni

#### Risk #2: Established Players Enter Market

**Scenario**: Toptal, Accenture, or EPAM launch "startup division" with AI.

**Impact**: Brand competition, talent war, price pressure.

**Mitigation**:
1. **Speed**: Move fast to lock in 30+ accelerators before they notice
2. **Specialization**: Go deep on startups (they're generalists)
3. **Local**: Spain/Southern Europe focus (they're global, less local expertise)
4. **Relationships**: Personal touch vs corporate machine
5. **Data moat**: Proprietary startup benchmarks they can't easily replicate

### 5.3 Operational Risks

#### Risk #1: Key Person Dependency

**Scenario**: One or more founders leave, or key team member quits.

**Impact**: Knowledge loss, client relationships at risk, team morale.

**Mitigation**:
1. **Documentation**: Everything documented (processes, client relationships, platform architecture)
2. **Cross-training**: Multiple people know each critical area
3. **Succession planning**: Identify and develop future leaders
4. **Vesting**: Founder vesting over 4 years
5. **Retention**: Competitive compensation, equity participation, culture

#### Risk #2: Quality Degradation During Scaling

**Scenario**: Rapid growth, new hires not properly trained, quality drops.

**Impact**: Client complaints, churn, reputation damage, NPS decline.

**Mitigation**:
1. **Controlled growth**: Cap client intake to match hiring (don't overcommit)
2. **Training program**: 2-week onboarding for all new developers
3. **Quality metrics**: Track code quality, NPS, project success in real-time
4. **Senior oversight**: All projects have Tech Lead review
5. **Client feedback**: Weekly check-ins, quarterly NPS surveys

## Conclusion

### Key Takeaways

1. **Hybrid Model is Strategic**: Services fund platform development, platform enables services scalability. They're symbiotic, not competing.

2. **Transition Requires Discipline**: Without clear separation (teams, metrics, processes), services will always win (urgent > important). Must protect platform development time.

3. **Platform Adoption is Critical**: If services clients don't adopt platform, you're just an agency. Mandatory usage during services + transition support is key.

4. **Accelerators are Lever**: Most efficient channel (1 partnership = 10-30 clients). Lock in 30+ partnerships before competitors notice.

5. **Data is Moat**: Every service engagement generates data that improves AI platform. 200+ startups = proprietary insights competitors can't replicate.

6. **Timeline is Realistic**: 3-year transition from services-led to platform-led is achievable but requires focus, investment, and execution discipline.

### Next Steps

1. **Founders Align**: Review this strategy, debate, commit to hybrid model
2. **Pick Year 1 Priorities**: Lock in on 3 strategic priorities (PRD Generator, 10 accelerators, methodology IP)
3. **Build Financial Model**: Detailed cash flow, hiring plan, fundraising decision
4. **Execute**: Start services, launch platform MVP, win first accelerator partnerships

**The hybrid model is your competitive advantage. Execute it well, and Collybrix becomes the category-defining "Agentic Technical Partner" for European startups.**
