## 1. Context - Why Startups Fail

### **Headline**
90% of startups fail. 70% from preventable technical mistakes.

### **Subheadline**
Your brilliant idea won't matter if your tech foundation crumbles.

### **Body Copy**

**Paragraph 1:**
You've got 18 months of runway. Your MVP is held together with duct tape. Your team is firefighting instead of building. Sound familiar? You're not alone—58% of startup CTOs report critical technical debt within Year 1.

**Paragraph 2:**
The real killer? Rebuilding your MVP costs €45,000 and 3x more time. While you're fixing yesterday's shortcuts, competitors are stealing your customers. Technical debt isn't just code—it's your startup's death by a thousand cuts.

**Paragraph 3:**
We've mentored 100+ teams through this exact crisis. The solution isn't choosing between speed or quality—it's having the right methodology and tools to achieve both. Build fast AND build right. It's possible, and we'll show you how.

### **Key Statistics/Data Points**
- **90%** startup failure rate
- **70%** fail from technical execution problems
- **€45,000** average cost to fix bad architecture
- **3x longer** to market when rebuilding
- **25%** of CTO time wasted on technical debt

### **Visual Concept Suggestions**
- **Hero Visual:** Animated split path showing "Without Collybrix" (descending into chaos) vs "With Collybrix" (ascending to success)
- **Stats Cards:** Large, bold numbers with micro-animations on scroll
- **Icon Grid:** Common failure points (crashes, bugs, burnout, debt)

### **Call-to-Action**
Stop building tomorrow's technical debt →

## Content Guidelines

### Writing Style
- **Short sentences.** Maximum impact.
- **You-focused:** "Your team," "Your startup," not "We provide"
- **Specific numbers:** "€45,000" not "expensive"

- **Scannable:** Bold key phrases, bullet points, short paragraphs

### Headline Formulas
- Problem + Impact: "90% fail. 70% preventably."
- Number + Benefit: "30 methodologies. One perfect fit."
- Metaphor + Result: "Agents that code like seniors."

### CTA Variations
- Action-oriented: "Match your methodology →"
- Problem-solving: "Stop building debt →"
- Curiosity: "See the platform in action →"
